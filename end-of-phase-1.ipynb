    "## Aviation Accident Risk Analysis: Data-Driven Recommendations for Safer Investments\n",
    "This project explores historical aviation accident data to identify patterns, contributing factors, and risk profiles associated with various aircraft models, flight conditions, and operational phases. By integrating accident records with regulatory data, weather conditions, and aircraft registration details, I aim to uncover actionable insights that support strategic decision-making—particularly for stakeholders assessing aircraft safety before investment or deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a combination of statistical techniques and visual analytics, this analysis reveals key trends spanning decades of incidents. The ultimate goal: to deliver **at least three concrete, data-backed business recommendations** that enhance aviation safety and reduce investment risk for operators, insurers, and aviation decision-makers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guiding Questions for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To shape meaningful business recommendations and uncover the underlying factors contributing to aviation accidents, the following key questions will guide me in my analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Which aircraft models are associated with the highest and lowest accident rates, and how do these rates compare when normalized by fleet size or registration volume?**  \n",
    "   *→ Informs investment risk by identifying safer aircraft models.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What role do weather conditions play in aviation accidents, and which specific weather types are most frequently linked to severe outcomes?**  \n",
    "   *→ Supports operational planning and risk mitigation under adverse weather.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **To what extent do regulatory or maintenance-related issues contribute to accident frequency or severity?**  \n",
    "   *→ Informs policy adjustments and helps rank compliance risk across aircraft categories.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Have accident patterns shifted over time, and what does this reveal about the effectiveness of safety regulations or technological advancements?**  \n",
    "   *→ Tracks progress and identifies areas needing continued focus.*\n"

    "- It is a **duplicate of another column** (redundancy).\n",
    "- The data is **irrelevant to the current analysis objectives** (e.g., IDs or metadata not used for joins or context).\n",
    "- It is **impossible to interpret or decode** (e.g., poorly documented, encoded variables with no lookup).\n",

    "- Multiple incidents involving the same aircraft over time (which is valid),\n",

    "- Some entries even share similar event locations — possibly indicating recycled registrations, duplicate records, or poor documentation.\n",

    "Many entries use generic or placeholder values like `\"NONE\"`, `\"UNREG\"`, and `\"USAF\"`. These typically indicate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unregistered aircraft (especially experimental or military),\n",
    "- Law enforcement or military aircraft with non-standard ID systems,\n",
    "- Or situations where the actual registration wasn't available.\n",

    "## 9. FAR DESCRIPTION\n",
    "\n",
    "The `far_description` column shows the FAA regulation under which each flight was operated. It’s an important feature for identifying the operational context—whether the flight was general aviation, commercial, agricultural, or something else entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Cleaning Process\n",
    "\n",
    "This column was messy—some entries were full descriptions like `\"Part 91: General Aviation\"` while others were shorthand like `\"091\"`. I created a mapping that standardized everything into clean, consistent categories such as `\"Part 91\"`, `\"Part 135\"`, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- `\"091\"`, `\"091K\"`, and `\"Part 91F: Special Flt Ops.\"` were all mapped to `\"Part 91\"`\n",
    "- `\"PUBU\"`, `\"Public Use\"`, and `\"Public Aircraft\"` were grouped under `\"Public Use\"`\n",
    "- Military designations like `\"NUSC\"`, `\"NUSN\"`, and `\"ARMF\"` became `\"Military\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "I applied this mapping directly on the original `far_description` \n",
    "\n",
    "###  What about the missing values?\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, this column had **over 54,000 missing values**, which is a huge chunk out of the ~82,000 rows. I wanted to reduce that in a meaningful way without introducing bias. Here's what I did:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I built a reference map using the most frequent aircraft `make` and `model` combinations that already had valid `far_description` values.\n",
    "2. Then, for each row that was still missing, I tried to infer the `far_description` based on its `make_model` or just the `make` if the combo wasn’t in the map.\n",
    "3. If I couldn’t infer anything confidently, I left it as `'Unknown'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brought the missing count down to **14,165**, which is a significant improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this column easier to interpret, I added a new column called `far_description_explained` with short descriptions for each FAR Part. Here’s a quick breakdown of what each part means:\n",
    "\n",
    "| FAR Part | Description |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| Part 91  | General Operating and Flight Rules – covers non-commercial (general aviation) flights. |\n",
    "| Part 121 | Air Carrier Operations – for scheduled commercial airlines and large aircraft. |\n",
    "| Part 135 | Commuter and On-Demand Operations – includes air taxis, charter flights, small cargo. |\n",
    "| Part 137 | Agricultural Aircraft Operations – crop dusting, aerial application, etc. |\n",
    "| Part 129 | Foreign Air Carriers – operations of foreign airlines in U.S. airspace. |\n",
    "| Part 133 | Rotorcraft External Load – operations involving lifting external loads with helicopters. |\n",
    "| Part 125 | Large Aircraft Non-Commercial – 20+ passengers or over 6,000 lbs not under Part 121. |\n",
    "| Part 103 | Ultralight Vehicles – very small, lightweight aircraft; no license required. |\n",
    "| Part 107 | Commercial Drone Operations – rules for unmanned aerial systems (UAS). |\n",
    "| Public Use | Government-operated or military aircraft not under civil FARs. |\n",
    "| Military | Military aircraft operations (Navy, Army, or Defense-related). |\n",
    "| Other | Other classifications or uncategorized FAA rules (e.g., Part 437 - experimental). |\n",
    "| Unknown | No applicable FAR identified or insufficient data. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion \n",
    "This feature was tricky to clean, but using aircraft characteristics for guided imputation helped reduce the noise without making wild guesses. The added explanation column also helps give this variable real interpretive power in my analysis.\n"

    "###  Overall Downward Trend\n",
    "There's a clear decline in the number of accidents over time, particularly from the 1980s onward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Drivers\n",
    "Several factors may have contributed to this positive trend:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advancements in aviation technology  \n",
    "- Stricter safety regulations and enforcement  \n",
    "- Improved pilot training and maintenance protocols  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Decade-Level Subsets\n",
    "When I analyzed the data by decade, the trend remained consistent—fewer accidents as time progressed. This supports the idea that safety standards have steadily improved over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Recent Insights (2010–2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A sharp decline is visible leading up to 2020, likely influenced by **COVID-19 restrictions** that significantly reduced flight volumes worldwide.\n",
    "- There's a **slight uptick post-2020**, possibly due to the rebound in air travel. However, I would need more recent data to confirm if this is a sustained trend or just a temporary spike.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Although historical data provides important context, I find that **recent trends (2010–2022)** are more relevant for driving actionable business decisions today. By focusing on recent accident behavior, I can help the company align its strategies with **current risk levels**, rather than outdated patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Business 1: Prioritize Modern Aircraft (2015 and Newer)\n",
    "\n",
    "My analysis of accident trends over time reveals a notable decline in aviation incidents starting from 2015, with 2020 marking the lowest point in the dataset. While there is a minor rise in incidents post-2020, this is likely tied to the resurgence in air traffic following pandemic-induced slowdowns.\n",

    "- _Are certain aircraft makes and models more likely to be involved in severe accidents?_\n",
    "- _Do personal or instructional flights carry more risk than business or executive flights?_\n",
    "- _Is accident severity influenced by aircraft category or engine configuration?_\n",
    "- _Are non-scheduled flights significantly riskier than scheduled ones?_\n",
    "- _Do regional patterns exist in injury severity or accident impact?_\n",

    "## 2. Aircraft Model vs. Injury Severity\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Observation & Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "This bivariate analysis uncovers a stark pattern:  \n",
    "Accidents involving the **most frequent aircraft models** in this dataset overwhelmingly result in **fatal injuries**. Survival rates are minimal — particularly among small aircraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Contributing Factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aircraft Size & Structure**  \n",
    "  Most accidents involve **1–2 seaters** or small personal aircraft. In such cases, structural limits and lack of onboard safety features mean **crashes are often unsurvivable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flight Purpose**  \n",
    "  Many of these aircraft are used for **personal or instructional flights**, which are:\n",
    "  - Less stringently regulated\n",
    "  - Often piloted by less experienced operators\n",
    "  - Subject to broader environmental and operational variability\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Popularity vs. Safety**  \n",
    "  Even among well-known models — like the *Boeing A75N1* — **fatality is the leading outcome**.  \n",
    "  This suggests the nature of the crash, rather than the model’s build quality alone, drives survivability.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Notably**, commercial and corporate models are underrepresented in the dataset. This is not likely due to underreporting, but rather because:\n",
    "> - These aircraft operate under **tight regulatory frameworks**\n",
    "> - Pilots are **professionally trained**\n",
    "> - Flight conditions are **tightly controlled**\n",

    "#### **Favor Commercial & Business-Class Aircraft**\n",
    "- These aircraft show **lower accident rates**.\n",
    "- Crashes are statistically rare and often more survivable.\n",
    "- Ideal for **reliable, large-scale operations** such as logistics, charter, or regional transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  **If Entering the Small Aircraft Market, Raise the Safety Bar:**\n",
    "- Employ **highly trained pilots** with structured recurrent training.\n",
    "- Equip aircraft with **modern avionics, weather monitoring, and emergency systems**.\n",
    "- Enforce **stringent maintenance schedules** and operational protocols.\n",
    "- Target **niche, high-value sectors** like:\n",

    " ## 2. *Engine-Type and Engine-Count: Why I Excluded from Bivariate*\n",
    "\n",
    "When conducting a risk-focused bivariate analysis of aviation accidents, it's tempting to include technical specs like `engine_type` and `number_of_engines`. However, **these variables were intentionally excluded**, and for good reason — the goal of this project is to assess **human-centered aviation risk**, not mechanical performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mission: Understand Human Risk, Not Machinery\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is meant to guide investment decisions with a **people-first approach**. We prioritize metrics that reflect **injury and fatality outcomes**, because:\n",
    "- **Aviation is about moving people and cargo** — but here, we focus on **human safety**.\n",
    "- Variables like `injury_severity_clean` and `total_individuals_affected` directly capture the **true impact of each accident** on human lives.\n",
    "- Engine-related fields lack the depth needed for **reliable, ethical conclusions** about safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why Engine Variables Were Not Used\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.  Lack of Technical Depth\n",
    "- The dataset contains only broad engine categories (e.g., \"RECIPROCATING\", \"TURBO-FAN\").\n",
    "- It provides **no engine performance data, failure logs, or maintenance records**.\n",
    "- As such, **any conclusions drawn would be speculative and potentially misleading**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. All Engines Are Certified for Safety\n",
    "- Aviation engines must meet **strict FAA, EASA, and ICAO safety certifications**.\n",
    "- By the time an engine is installed on an aircraft, it has undergone **years of testing**.\n",
    "- **Engine type does not correlate directly with crash risk** unless coupled with real-world failure and maintenance data — which we don't have.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Slow Tech Adoption in Aviation\n",
    "- Aircraft engine innovation moves **very slowly** due to:\n",
    "  - **Decades-long aircraft life cycles**\n",
    "  - **High certification costs**\n",
    "  - **Extreme focus on safety and reliability**\n",
    "- Example: The **CFM56 engine**, developed in the 1970s, still powers thousands of planes in 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Low Engine Diversity\n",
    "- Just a **handful of companies dominate** aircraft engine manufacturing:\n",
    "  - **GE Aviation, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, CFM International, Safran**\n",
    "  - In general aviation: **Lycoming, Continental, Rotax, Jabiru**\n",
    "- This makes `engine_type` a **poor proxy** for meaningful variability in safety outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.  Poor External Joinability\n",
    "- Although `registration_number` exists, it’s not unique or clean enough to **reliably join with FAA engine data**.\n",
    "- Attempting to enrich this field would lead to **inconsistent merges or forced imputations**, weakening analytical validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Focus on Human-Centric Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `injury_severity_clean`  \n",
    "- Offers a **clear, categorical representation** of human harm: *Fatal*, *Serious*, *Minor*, *None*  \n",
    "- Easy to aggregate and visualize across aircraft types and flight conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `total_individuals_affected`  \n",
    "- Captures **true accident scale**, regardless of how many people were onboard.\n",
    "- Offers a **normalized, scalable lens on impact** — especially useful across different aircraft classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Importantly, **both variables are clean and require no imputation**, making them ethically appropriate for risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### Final Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "While engines are mechanically vital, they are **not suitable for this dataset’s scope or depth of analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, to assess aircraft safety risk:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prioritize models with historically low fatality outcomes.**\n",
    "- **Ensure top-tier maintenance, regardless of engine type.**\n",
    "- **Invest in structured flight operations** (scheduled, commercial services).\n",

    "\n",
    "Analyzing `event_year` against `injury_severity_clean` reveals a compelling story:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Steady decline in accidents and fatalities** leading up to 2020.\n",
    "- **Sharp dip in 2020** — directly aligning with the global halt in air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
    "- **Sudden spike post-2020**, particularly in **fatal injuries** — likely due to:\n",
    "  - Aircraft being rapidly brought out of storage.\n",
    "  - Pilots returning after long inactivity (skill fade).\n",
    "  - Ground crews and maintenance teams working through massive backlogs.\n",
    "  - Operational inconsistencies in the early reopening phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite overall improvements in aviation safety across decades, one stubborn fact remains:\n",
    "> “When accidents do happen — they are still overwhelmingly fatal.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern underscores the **dual nature of aviation risk**:\n",
    "- **Frequency** can be reduced via smarter scheduling, oversight, and policy.\n",
    "- But **severity**, when incidents occur, **remains catastrophic** — particularly for small, general aviation aircraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Invest in Preventive Infrastructure**\n",
    "- Shift focus from **reactive safety** to **proactive prevention**.\n",
    "- Maintain readiness audits and technical assessments for any fleet that’s been grounded — especially after industry-wide disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Scrutinize Restart Phases**\n",
    "- Avoid launching or scaling operations during unstable recovery periods (like post-2020) unless you have:\n",
    "  - Fully re-certified pilots\n",
    "  - Proven aircraft airworthiness\n",
    "  - Updated risk assessments\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Incorporate Historical Severity in Risk Modeling**\n",
    "- When creating actuarial or operational models, factor in **long-term severity trends** — especially for insurance, underwriting, and investment decisions.\n",
    "- Account for post-disruption volatility as a **separate risk class**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Support Crew Reentry Programs**\n",
    "- Partner with training institutions to provide **post-grounding recertification programs**.\n",
    "- Consider subsidies or partnerships for simulation-based retraining to mitigate pilot and crew risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "> The takeaway isn’t just that fewer flights mean fewer accidents — it’s that **restarting too quickly, without adequate preparation, is a risk multiplier**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that **univariate** and **bivariate** explorations have illuminated the behavior of individual variables and their pairwise relationships, we deepen our investigation by examining how **three or more variables interact** simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a high-risk, tightly regulated domain like aviation, **complex variable interplays** often reveal the most actionable and strategic insights. This level of analysis moves us from \"what happened\" to \"why it happens under specific operational contexts.\"\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of multivariate analysis is to **pinpoint combinations** of factors — including aircraft models, flight purposes, and injury outcomes — that drive **higher or lower operational risk**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing so, we empower decision-makers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose safer aircraft and operation types,\n",
    "- Design smarter business strategies for aviation entry,\n",
    "- Implement targeted safety and maintenance protocols,\n",
    "- Build more nuanced, data-backed risk models.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Key Axes of Exploration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Aircraft Usage Context**\n",
    "   - `purpose_of_flight` (e.g., personal, instructional, business, commercial)\n",
    "   - `schedule_type` (scheduled vs non-scheduled)\n",

    "3. **Temporal and Geographic Trends**\n",
    "   - `event_year`, `state_full`, `weather_condition`\n",

    "\n",
    "> A small aircraft might seem risky overall, but when used for **instructional purposes in Arizona**, its fatality rate might rise sharply due to high flight school volume and less experienced pilots.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of **contextual insight** can only be uncovered through multivariate analysis — and it's exactly the kind of intelligence that drives **precision policy, investment, and operational decisions**.\n",
