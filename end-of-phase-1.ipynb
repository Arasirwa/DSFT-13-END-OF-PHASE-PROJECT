    "## Aviation Accident Risk Analysis: Data-Driven Recommendations for Safer Investments\n",
    "This project explores historical aviation accident data to identify patterns, contributing factors, and risk profiles associated with various aircraft models, flight conditions, and operational phases. By integrating accident records with regulatory data, weather conditions, and aircraft registration details, I aim to uncover actionable insights that support strategic decision-making—particularly for stakeholders assessing aircraft safety before investment or deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a combination of statistical techniques and visual analytics, this analysis reveals key trends spanning decades of incidents. The ultimate goal: to deliver **at least three concrete, data-backed business recommendations** that enhance aviation safety and reduce investment risk for operators, insurers, and aviation decision-makers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guiding Questions for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To shape meaningful business recommendations and uncover the underlying factors contributing to aviation accidents, the following key questions will guide me in my analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Which aircraft models are associated with the highest and lowest accident rates, and how do these rates compare when normalized by fleet size or registration volume?**  \n",
    "   *→ Informs investment risk by identifying safer aircraft models.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What role do weather conditions play in aviation accidents, and which specific weather types are most frequently linked to severe outcomes?**  \n",
    "   *→ Supports operational planning and risk mitigation under adverse weather.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are there identifiable trends in accidents across different phases of flight (e.g., takeoff, cruise, landing), and do these vary by aircraft type or operator category?**  \n",
    "   *→ Guides targeted safety interventions at high-risk phases.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **To what extent do regulatory or maintenance-related issues contribute to accident frequency or severity?**  \n",
    "   *→ Informs policy adjustments and helps rank compliance risk across aircraft categories.*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Have accident patterns shifted over time, and what does this reveal about the effectiveness of safety regulations or technological advancements?**  \n",
    "   *→ Tracks progress and identifies areas needing continued focus.*\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Are there regional or geographical patterns in accident occurrence, especially in relation to weather or regulation enforcement?**  \n",
    "   *→ Offers strategic insight for operators expanding into new territories.*"

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Dropping Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "I will drop a column if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has a **high percentage of missing values** (typically > 50–70%) and is not critical for analysis.\n",
    "- It contains **only a single unique value** (i.e., zero variance — no information gain).\n",
    "- It is a **duplicate of another column** (redundancy).\n",
    "- The data is **irrelevant to the current analysis objectives** (e.g., IDs or metadata not used for joins or context).\n",
    "- It is **impossible to interpret or decode** (e.g., poorly documented, encoded variables with no lookup).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Dropping Rows\n",
    "\n",
    "I will  drop a row if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Critical columns are missing**, especially where imputation is not appropriate (e.g., timestamps, unique identifiers, target variable).\n",
    "- It contains **clearly erroneous or corrupted data** (e.g., wrong data types, impossible values like negative injuries or invalid dates).\n",
    "- It is a **complete duplicate** of another row.\n",
    "- It **violates integrity constraints**, such as conflicting values across dependent fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cautions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider **imputation or transformation** before dropping — dropping should be the **last resort** if data is unrecoverable.\n",
    "- **Document your rationale** for each drop, especially in sensitive or audit-heavy domains like aviation or healthcare.\n",
    "- Consider the **impact on representativeness**: Dropping too many rows can introduce bias or reduce statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use `.info()`, `.isnull().sum()`, and `.nunique()` early in EDA to assess the quality of each column and  back decisions with simple visuals (e.g., **missingness heatmaps** or **histograms**).\n"
