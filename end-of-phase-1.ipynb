    "## Aviation Accident Risk Analysis: Data-Driven Recommendations for Safer Investments\n",
    "This project explores historical aviation accident data to identify patterns, contributing factors, and risk profiles associated with various aircraft models, flight conditions, and operational phases. By integrating accident records with regulatory data, weather conditions, and aircraft registration details, I aim to uncover actionable insights that support strategic decision-making—particularly for stakeholders assessing aircraft safety before investment or deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a combination of statistical techniques and visual analytics, this analysis reveals key trends spanning decades of incidents. The ultimate goal: to deliver **at least three concrete, data-backed business recommendations** that enhance aviation safety and reduce investment risk for operators, insurers, and aviation decision-makers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guiding Questions for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To shape meaningful business recommendations and uncover the underlying factors contributing to aviation accidents, the following key questions will guide me in my analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Which aircraft models are associated with the highest and lowest accident rates, and how do these rates compare when normalized by fleet size or registration volume?**  \n",
    "   *→ Informs investment risk by identifying safer aircraft models.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What role do weather conditions play in aviation accidents, and which specific weather types are most frequently linked to severe outcomes?**  \n",
    "   *→ Supports operational planning and risk mitigation under adverse weather.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are there identifiable trends in accidents across different phases of flight (e.g., takeoff, cruise, landing), and do these vary by aircraft type or operator category?**  \n",
    "   *→ Guides targeted safety interventions at high-risk phases.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **To what extent do regulatory or maintenance-related issues contribute to accident frequency or severity?**  \n",
    "   *→ Informs policy adjustments and helps rank compliance risk across aircraft categories.*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Have accident patterns shifted over time, and what does this reveal about the effectiveness of safety regulations or technological advancements?**  \n",
    "   *→ Tracks progress and identifies areas needing continued focus.*\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Are there regional or geographical patterns in accident occurrence, especially in relation to weather or regulation enforcement?**  \n",
    "   *→ Offers strategic insight for operators expanding into new territories.*"

    "  - Any obvious missing or invalid entries?\n",
    "  - What columns are useful?\n",

    "- Identify common keys for joining:\n",
    "  - `Registration.Number` ↔ `N-Number` (FAA)\n",
    "  - `Model` ↔ `MODEL` (FAA)\n",
    "  - Date + Lat/Lon proximity ↔ GHCND Weather\n",

    "To enrich the aviation accident dataset and gain deeper insight into aircraft-specific characteristics, we incorporate supplementary data provided by the FAA. These files contain detailed registration, technical, and deregistration records for civil aircraft in the United States. Below is a description of each dataset and its intended use in the project:\n",

    "- **Usage**: We will use `MASTER.txt` to extract key aircraft metadata and merge it with the main accident dataset using the `N-NUMBER` (which corresponds to `Registration.Number`). This will allow analysis of accident trends based on aircraft age, type, ownership category, and certification status.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `ACFTREF.txt`\n",
    "- **Description**: A reference file mapping manufacturer and model codes to their descriptive names, including weight class and engine type.\n",
    "- **Usage**: This will be used to decode the `MFR MDL CODE` in the `MASTER.txt` file, enabling us to identify specific aircraft makes and models in a readable format. This is essential for evaluating accident patterns associated with certain aircraft types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `ENGINE.txt`\n",
    "- **Description**: Contains technical specifications of various aircraft engines, linked by engine model codes.\n",
    "- **Usage**: We can link this to the engine code field in the `MASTER.txt` file (`ENG MFR MDL`) to analyze whether engine type or engine-specific characteristics correlate with accident severity or frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. `DEREG.txt`\n",
    "- **Description**: Records of deregistered aircraft, including reasons and dates of deregistration.\n",
    "- **Usage**: This file may help in identifying aircraft that were involved in an accident and subsequently deregistered. We can use this to validate the aircraft's operational status post-accident and examine patterns in deregistration reasons.\n",
