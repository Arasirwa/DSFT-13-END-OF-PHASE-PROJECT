# ‚úàÔ∏è Aviation Accident Risk Analysis

## üìä Overview

This project analyzes aviation accident data to support strategic decision-making for a company entering the aviation industry. The goal is to identify the safest and most suitable aircraft for commercial and private investment, based on historical accident trends and key flight attributes.

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Aviation Accident Database Synopses](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses)
- **Columns Used**:
  - `event_date`, `event_year`, `event_decade`
  - `aircraft_make`, `aircraft_model`, `make_model`
  - `aircraft_damage`, `injury_severity_clean`, `total_individuals_affected`
  - `weather_condition`, `schedule_type`, `purpose_of_flight`
  - `state_full`, `far_description_explained`, `report_status`

## üß† Business Problem

> Your company is expanding into new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises but lack knowledge about aviation risks.  
>
> You are tasked with determining which aircraft pose the **lowest investment risk** and converting those findings into **actionable insights** to guide procurement for the new aviation division.

## üìå Key Questions Answered

- Which aircraft models are most frequently involved in accidents?
- What injury severity patterns exist across aircraft types?
- How do seasonal trends and weather conditions influence accident rates?
- What regulatory categories (FAR descriptions) show better safety records?
- Which flight schedules and purposes are most prone to incidents?

## üìä Tableau Dashboard

A fully interactive Tableau dashboard was developed, consisting of:

1. **Accidents Over Time** ‚Äì Shows overall safety improvements.
2. **Monthly Trends** ‚Äì Highlights peak risk months (June‚ÄìAugust).
3. **Injury Severity by Aircraft Model** ‚Äì Correlates model frequency with accident impact.
4. **FAR Regulation Impact** ‚Äì Assesses safety under different regulatory brackets.
5. **Aircrafts Frequently Involved** ‚Äì Identifies models with the highest impact.
6. **Filters** ‚Äì Includes weather conditions, FAR description, and flight schedule.

## ‚úÖ Business Recommendations

1. **Invest in Commercial & Business-Class Aircraft**  
   Safer, more regulated, and better suited for large-scale operations.

2. **Avoid High-Risk Small Aircraft**  
   Especially those used for personal or instructional purposes.

3. **Purchase Newer Aircraft**  
   Modern planes feature superior safety systems and reliability.

4. **Leverage FAR 121 and 135 Operations**  
   These show stronger safety performance due to strict regulatory oversight.

5. **Schedule Flights During Lower-Risk Periods**  
   Avoid peak summer months where accident rates historically spike.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Python**: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis (pandas, plotly).
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboard for storytelling and business intelligence.
